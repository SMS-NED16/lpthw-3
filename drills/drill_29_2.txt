Indenting is a way of separating statements into blocks. By indenting the code under the if statement, we're explicitly telling Python that the code is the body of the if statement and that it should only be executed if the conditional evaluates to true.

This is similar to how the statements under a function definition were also indented so that we could explicitly tell Python which statements constituted the body of the function.

open_exp = """open is a built-in Python function that is used for 
opening a file or a bitstream for reading data into a programme. The open
function takes several arguments, amongst which the required argument defiens the 
name of the file to be opened (or the filepath if this file is not in the same directory.
The open function also takes additional arguments to modify the behaviour of the read operation.
For instance, the `mode` argument can be set to one of several flags to change the read operation 
to a write/append operation, if needed.

open can also take an additiona argument which specifies the encoding of the file that is to be opened.
This is important because files with certain encodings such as ANSI cannot necessarily be read by 
Python prorammes that use other encodings such as UTF-8 by default."""

sys_exp = """The `sys` module is one of Python's standard, built-in modules that contains a collection
of properties (variables and objects) as well as methods (functions specific to the module). These properties
and methods are used and maintained by the interpreter and are used to 'interact strongly with the interpreter.'
This includes functions that will be called when an error occurs (to show the user the type of error as well as where
the error occurred), an object/variable to store the command line argument i.e. the keywords that must be passed to the 
command line to run a Python script, as well as stdin and print objects that are used by the Python
interpreter for I/O.

os_exp = """The `os` module imports a bunch of classes (methods and attributes) that can be used to make portable
programmes. That is, if a programme is made only with the methods and attributes defined in the sys module, it is more 
likely to run well on other development environments and machines."""

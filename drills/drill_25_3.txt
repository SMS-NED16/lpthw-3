Made a generic import using the following line
>>> from ex25 import *

In programming/computer systems, the * argument usally means 'ALL'
This line is telling the Python interpreter to import ALL the functions from the ex25.py file
This is basically the same as copying them directly in to the interpreter 
The problem with this approach is that the function names could conflict with other identically named functions that we've written.
So Python would have no way of knowing if sort_words means it should call ex25's version of sort_words or another module's version of sort_words
The advantage is that we don't have to precede each function call with the ex25. notation

>>> sentence = "All good things come to those who wait."
>>> words = break_words(sentence)
>>> words
['All', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'to', 'those', 'who', 'wait.']
>>> sorted_words = sort_words(words)
>>> sorted_words
['All', 'come', 'good', 'things', 'those', 'to', 'wait.', 'who']
>>> print_first_word(words)
All
>>> print_last_word(words)
wait.
>>> words
['good', 'things', 'come', 'to', 'those', 'who']
>>> print_first_word(sorted_words)
All
>>> print_last_word(sorted_words)
who
>>> sorted_words = sort_sentence(sentence)
>>> sorted_words
['All', 'come', 'good', 'things', 'those', 'to', 'wait.', 'who']
>>> print_first_and_last_sorted(sentence)
All
who

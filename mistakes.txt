* Missed a hyphen in a string literal
* Added extra whitespace to the beginning of each line in a triple quote delimited string literal. This is bad because such string literals do not ignore whitespace. 
* Lots of unicode decode errors
* Don't know how n{NAME} works - what is a NAMED variable of the ASCII database?
* Missing the ending quote in a formatting string leads to an EOF file error.
* The input function takes no end=' ' argument, or any keyword argument for that matter.
* You can enter a formatted string just about anywhere. For instance, in a write operation, there is no need to use the string.format() method to create a formatted string with variables, and then write this formatted string.
Instead, just use target.write(f"{var} is the {type} variable that I have decided to enter. This {name} shows how to use formatted strings for write operations.")

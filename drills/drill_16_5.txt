It is not necessary to call the truncate method before write. This is because write will implicitly call the truncate method on its own, which means calling the truncate method before a write method is redundant.

This means that
1. We do not need to call the truncate method on a file object before using the write operation on the same object.
2. The write method will ALWAYS erase or overwrite the previous contents of the target file object and replace them with the argument passed to it.

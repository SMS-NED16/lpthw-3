The setup file
The setup.py file is a Python script that is used to install a package using 
the distutils module. The 'distutils' module or distribution utilities package is
the standard library for packaging Python modules for distribution and integration into
other Python programmes. If a downloaded package has a setup.py, it can easily be 
installed in your version of Python (or in a virtual environment) using python setup.py install.

It contains metadata about the package being installed. Some of this is useful for
documentation purposes (e.g. the name of the module, its URL, the creator, etc.). Other
data is useful for installation - a list of dependencies (other modules required for this
module to run).

If a Python package contains the setup.py file, it has been packaged for distribution
with the distutils module

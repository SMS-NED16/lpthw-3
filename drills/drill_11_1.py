explanation = """
In Python, 'input()' is a method that allows us to prompt the user of a programme
for any kind of input. The input method stops execution of the programme until
a user enters some kind of data into the console (or other entry field) and presses enter.
The input function then takes the data entered by the user, converts it to a string, and 
returns it, which is why input() is always set to some variable.

The if code is a conditional statement. Any code placed under a conditional statement will be executed if and only if the conditional is satistfied. The if statement always has a condition which is an expression that can be evaluated to a True or False i.e. to a Boolean value.
If the condition evaluates to True, statements in the body of the if statement are executed.
If the condition evaluates to False, statements in the body of the if statement are not executed - the programme's flow of control skips the if statement entirely.

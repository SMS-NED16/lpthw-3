The seek function is one of the many built-in functions defined for file objects in Python 3. It changes the file object's position using an offset relative to a reference point. 

The default value for the optional reference point argument is 0, and it sets the reference point to the beginning of the file object. An argument of 1 sets the current file object position as the reference point, whereas an argument of 2 sets the end of the file as the reference point.

The offset is the number of lines ahead (or before) the parser of the file object is placed relative to the reference point.

To summarise, the file.seek method finds a specific position in the file from which to start parsing its contents.

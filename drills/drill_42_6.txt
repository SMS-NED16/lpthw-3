Yes, is-many relationships can exist in Python as Python allows multiple inheritance i.e. a class can inherit attributes and methods from multiple classes.

This is not recommended because of multiple inheritance leading to ambiguous function overriding. If A inherits from B and C, and both B and C have a function named 'do_something()', then A won't know which version of do_something to inherit. This is called the diamond problem, and is one of the reasons why multiple inheritance is often avoided.

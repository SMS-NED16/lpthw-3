In the introduction to this exercise, Zed called the 'if statement' a 'branch' in the programme's flow of control. Elif (which stands for 'else if') and 'else' are alternative branches that the programme can take if the condition for the 'if block' does not evaluate to true.

When an if statement's condition evaluates to false, then the elif block is the first alternate branch that the programme takes. If all elif blocks also fail to satisfy the condition, then the last alternative is the else block. This is the path taken by the programme if the if statement and ALL the else-if statements evaluate to false i.e. are skipped.
